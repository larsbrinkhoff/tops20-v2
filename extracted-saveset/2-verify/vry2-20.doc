VERIFY.DOC -- Changes from V1B to V2
March 1977



1.0  SUMMARY

The verification package consists of a series of  Batch  control  jobs
which  are to be run as part of the DECsystem-20 software installation
procedure.  These jobs check for the existence and minimal functioning
of  all executable and run-time files which should have been delivered
to a customer.  Wherever appropriate, version numbers of programs  are
checked.

The package will run on Release 2 of DECsystem-20 software.

The package requires all distributed software to be available  on  the
system when it is run.

For further information, see:

     DECsystem-20 Software Installation Guide
     <VERIFY>VERIFY.MEM



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

The difference between this release of VERIFY and the previous release
is  in  the table of module version numbers to be found in CONTRL.TXT.
They now reflect version numbers for Release 2.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

There are no known restrictions or deficiencies as of 29-Mar-77.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

No building of this package is  required,  since  the  package  itself
consists  of  the  running  of the supplied batch control files, using
source and data files also supplied.

The instructions for installing and executing the verification package
are included in the Software Installation Guide.
